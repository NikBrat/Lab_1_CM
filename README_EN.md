# Fourier analysis Lab Work â„–1
_ITMO/SPRING2024/FourierAnalysis_

## Content
In this laboratory work, we will be exploring the Fourier series:
- We will calculate the coefficients for both the trigonometric and exponential forms of the Fourier series
- We will use these coefficients to create and analyze Fourier images. 
- We will also check Parseval's equality to ensure that our calculations are correct

During this lab, we will work with both real and complex functions.
